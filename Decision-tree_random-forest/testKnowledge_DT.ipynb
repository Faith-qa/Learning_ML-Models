    "1. What is the approximate depth of a Decision Tree trained (without restrictions) on a training set with one million instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "***The depth of a well-balanced binary tree containing m leaves is equal to log2(m),2 rounded up. A binary Decision Tree (one that makes only binary decisions, as is the case with all trees in Scikit-Learn) will end up more or less well balanced at the end of training, with one leaf per training instance if it is trained without restrictions. Thus, if the training set contains one million instances, the Decision Tree will have a depth of log2(106) ≈ 20 (actually a bit more since the tree will generally not be perfectly well balanced).***\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is a node’s Gini impurity generally lower or greater than its parent’s? Is it generally lower/greater, or always lower/greater?\n",
    "\n",
    "   ***A hard voting classifier just counts the votes of each classifier in the ensemble and picks the class that gets the most votes. A soft voting classifier computes the average estimated class probability for each class and picks the class with the highest probability. This gives high-confidence votes more weight and often performs better, but it works only if every classifier is able to estimate class probabilities (e.g., for the SVM classifiers in Scikit-Learn you must set probability=True).***\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try decreasing max_depth?\n",
    "\n",
    "***It is quite possible to speed up training of a bagging ensemble by distributing it across multiple servers, since each predictor in the ensemble is independent of the others. The same goes for pasting ensembles and Random Forests, for the same reason. However, each predictor in a boosting ensemble is built based on the previous predictor, so training is necessarily sequential, and you will not gain anything by distributing training across multiple servers. Regarding stacking ensembles, all the predictors in a given layer are independent of each other, so they can be trained in parallel on multiple servers. However, the predictors in one layer can only be trained after the predictors in the previous layer have all been trained.***\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If a Decision Tree is underfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try scaling the input features?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ***With out-of-bag evaluation, each predictor in a bagging ensemble is evaluated using instances that it was not trained on (they were held out). This makes it possible to have a fairly unbiased evaluation of the ensemble without the need for an additional validation set. Thus, you have more instances available for training, and your ensemble can perform slightly better.***\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If it takes one hour to train a Decision Tree on a training set containing 1 million instances, roughly how much time will it take to train another Decision Tree on a training set containing 10 million instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "   ***When you are growing a tree in a Random Forest, only a random subset of the features is considered for splitting at each node. This is true as well for Extra-Trees, but they go one step further: rather than searching for the best possible thresholds, like regular Decision Trees do, they use random thresholds for each feature. This extra randomness acts like a form of regularization: if a Random Forest overfits the training data, Extra-Trees might perform better. Moreover, since Extra-Trees don’t search for the best possible thresholds, they are much faster to train than Random Forests. However, they are neither faster nor slower than Random Forests when making predictions.***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If your training set contains 100,000 instances, will setting presort=True speed up training?\n",
    "\n",
    "   ***If your AdaBoost ensemble underfits the training data, you can try increasing the number of estimators or reducing the regularization hyperparameters of the base estimator. You may also try slightly increasing the learning rate.***\n",
