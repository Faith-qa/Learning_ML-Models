    "# saving and Loading the Model\n",
    "saving a model is Keras is as simple as it gets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.save(\"my_keras_model\", save_format=\"tf\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "when you set `save_format=\"tf\"`, keras saves the model using TensorFlows's *SavedModel* format i.e: a directory with the given name containing several files and subdirectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "in particular, the *saved_model.pb* file contains the model's architecture and logic in the form of a serialized computation graph, so you don't need to deploy the model's source code inorder to use it in production:\n",
    "\n",
    "the SavedModel.pb file  is sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loading the model**\n",
    "\n",
    "to load the model and use it to evaluate it or make predictions \n",
    "\n",
    "we simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = tf.keras.models.load_model(\"my_keras_model\")\n",
    "\n",
    "y_pred_main, y_pred_aux = model.predict((X_new_wide, X_new_deep))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you can also use `save_weights()` and `load_weights()` to save and load only the parameter values. "

    "aving just the weights is faster and uses less disk space than saving the whole model, so it’s perfect to save quick checkpoints during training. If you’re training a big model, and it takes hours or days, then you must save checkpoints regularly in case the computer crashes. But how can you tell the `fit()` method to save checkpoints? Use callbacks."
